# KDE+/Q
Personal Study on [KDB+/Q](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lwshang.q).

Modification is inspired by [language-kdb-q](https://atom.io/packages/language-kdb-q).

This extension is generated by the [Yeoman generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-code) with Q.tmLanguage which can be easily found online. Specifically, I got it from the sublime-q extension.
